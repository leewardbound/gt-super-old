Lots of things.  
<ul>
<li /> First: read the question below.  Try to resolve the issue yourself.
<li /> Second: read the outstanding bugreports at
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas/issues">pyjamas bugreports</a>.
       Is there anything that vaguely looks related?  Read up on it.
       Does the discussion there have any resolution?
<li /> Third: decide whether the issue is best reported to the bugtracker
       or to pyjamas-dev or to both.  The point of the bugtracker is to
       be a formal record of issues that need to be fixed.  People's
       heads don't hold large amounts of information all the time, and
       priorities have to be assigned to tasks.  If you want the issue
       to be fixed for you, you need to make life easier not less easy
       for the developers to fix it.
<li /> Fourth: if you decide to contact pyjamas-dev, <b>before</b> you do so,
       there are some important things that you need to be aware of.
<li /> pyjamas is a part-time community-driven project, not a
       corporate-funded one.  your absolute top priority in contacting
       the development list is therefore to make it easy for people
       to respond.  the way to make it easy for people to respond is to do
       your homework: to provide absolute unambiguous and full information
       necessary to get people "up to speed".
<li /> To that end: if you have a problem, provide a complete worked example
       that can be downloaded and run as-is, with no additional effort
       required other than a few simple commands to install it and run it.
<li /> Provide full context.
<li /> Provide <b>full</b> context.
<li /> Provide <b>full context</b>.
<li /> Provide the version of the compiler; the version of python; the
       operating system; provide a complete list of all commands that
       had been run in order to get you to the point where you are, now.
<li /> If you are running an out-of-date version of the compiler, update
       the application to the latest svn version of the compiler <b>before</b>
       contacting the list.  There are insufficient resources to cater for
       older compilers.  You are welcome to spend <b>your</b> time
       back-porting fixes to the older releases.
<li /> In short: <b>think</b>.  "Will the people receiving this have to
       be mind-readers in order to answer my question?".  "What work
       will <b>they</b> have to do, to get <b>me</b> the results that
       <b>I</b> want?"
<li /> Give <i>some</i> sort of clear indication of a willingness to
       work with the people of the list to resolve the issue that you
       have.  A "hello, I'm new here, thank you in advance for any
       help" is usually all it takes, making the difference between
       the reader deciding to provide a terse but informative reply or
       a more detailed (and probably more useful) one.
<li /> When you get a response, <b>do what you've been recommended to do!</b>
       You got an answer, so why would you want to be disrespectful to the
       person who spent their personal time and money in composing a reply,
       by <b>not</b> following their advice?  If you don't understand the
       reply, that's fine - <i>say so</i>: there's no harm in saying,
       "I don't understand".
<li /> The other alternative is: if you're not going to do what you've
       been recommended to do, give <i>really</i> good reasons as to why.
       The point is: don't risk alienating the very people you need help
       from, in order to fix the problem.  Entertain them with the
       antics that you're getting up to by getting into a horribly
       tangly mess: yes.  Irritate them by wasting their time: no.
<li /> Once you've managed to solve a problem (in part or in full),
       <i>say so</i>.  And, if the solution involved following advice
       given, <i>say thank you!</i>.  The former is important for anyone
       else who may encounter the same problem.  The latter is important
       for if you want to ask their advice ever again.  If you don't
       say "thank you", don't be surprised to get a curt response next
       time, if you get one at all.
</ul>

<i>[Personal note from lkcl: I've done a lot of free software development,
and I've never, despite trying, been able to cover exactly everything,
first time, on reporting a problem / asking for help.  Software development
is complex.  "Full" reports are rare and time-consuming for the person
writing them, but that's just part of <b>your</b> job of writing <b>your</b>
app.  The key thing is that there should be enthusiasm behind
what you're doing: a good developer on a free software project will be
able to instantly tell that you're being enthusiastic (and are showing
a willingness to adapt), and will likely make allowances that they would
otherwise not tolerate.
The bottom line is, therefore: use your judgement; provide as much
information and context as you can; give some sort of indication of
willingness to follow the advice given; follow the advice
given; provide people with evidence that you've followed it (or an
explanation as to why you haven't), and say thank you if the advice helped.]
