There are four main ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li /> If you like, throw in lots of "alerts" into your application.
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import Window
Window.alert("Hello, here is an error")
</pre>
<li /> My favourite: add some HTML to the end of the page:
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas.ui.RootPanel import RootPanel
from pyjamas.ui.HTML import HTML
RootPanel().add(HTML("hello, here is an error")
</pre>
<li /> Another approach is to follow what examples/libtest/write.py does,
which you should just consider blatantly copying:
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import DOM

def getBodyElement():
    JS(""" return $doc.body; """)

def write(text):
    global data
    data += text
    DOM.setInnerHTML(element, data)

def writebr(text):
    write(text + "&lt;br /&gt;\n")

data = ""
element = DOM.createDiv()
DOM.appendChild(getBodyElement(), element)
</pre>
<li /> If you have followed the advice above of the previous question,
and have installed Firebug, then just insert a "print" statement, exactly
as you would in "standard" python.  All output is directed to "console.write",
where Firebug will add an object called "console" to the global namespace
of your browser, and will "write" anything that goes to that console.write()
function into a special debugging window.  If you haven't installed Firebug,
and you use "print", you will get an error (because there will be no object
called "console") in your browser's global namespace.  So make your life
easier, and install Firebug.  or not.
</ul>
<p>
A Window.alert is the easiest but also the most annoying.  It has the
advantage however of not disrupting the screen layout.  Perhaps
some day someone will do something really sophisticated, like provide
a "logger" module which throws up a nice separate window.
