<h2>Documentation and References</h2>

<p>A complete reference guide - the
 <a href="./api">API documentation</a> - is available, which
can be built locally using the gendocs.py script, in the
pyjamas distribution.
</p>

<p>There are also HOWTO Guides at the
<a href="./wiki">Pyjamas Wiki</a>.
These HOWTOs are written by users, for users, and will guide you
through the process of setting up and using Pyjamas, including with
your preferred web server framework (Django, Pylons, Web.py etc.)
</p>

<h2>Pyjamas Book</h2>

<p>An online version of the
<a href="http://pyjs.org/book/output/Bookreader.html">Pyjamas Book</a>
is available to read, and is in development. Contact
<a href="mailto:lkcl@lkcl.net">lkcl@lkcl.net</a>
if there are any issues that you believe should be covered; if you
find any errors; or if the book proves useful enough to be worth
paying for. The Bookreader itself is a Pyjamas application which
uses AJAX to load the contents as text files, and Wiki-like markup
is used, on the browser, to generate the HTML displayed.</p>
