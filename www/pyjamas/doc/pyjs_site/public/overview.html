<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Like GWT, Pyjamas translates a <span class="g">Python application
and libraries</span> (including UI widgets and DOM classes) into
a <span class="p">Javascript application and libraries</span>,
and packages it all up:</p>

<strong>pyjs</strong> translates Python code to Javascript by walking
the Python abstract syntax tree and generating Javascript.</p>

<p><img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="[2]" src="./img/num2.png">
<strong>pyjslib</strong> takes care of Python types that require
a custom Javascript implementation for pyjs to work. For example,
even though Python lists are similar to Javascript arrays, Python
lists are converted to custom objects that implement methods such
as <em>append</em>.</p>

<strong>UI widgets and a DOM library</strong> are provided as a
convenience. They are written in Python and, like everything else,
they are translated to Javascript for deployment. These are based
on those in GWT.</p>

<strong>build</strong> manages the overall translation of
individual components and creates a set of <code>.html</code>
and <code>.js</code> files that can be served up by a Web server.</p>
