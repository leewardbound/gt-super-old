# This IE-specific override is required because IE doesn't allow
# empty element to generate events. Therefore, when the mouse moves
# (or clicks) happen over *only* the GlassWidget (which is empty)
# they stop flowing. however, IE does provide setCapture/releaseCapture
# methods on elements which can be used to same effect as a regular
# GlassWidget.

# This file implements the IE version of GlassWidget simply by mapping
# the GlassWidget API to the use of setCapture/releaseCapture

        # remember it
        mousecapturer = target_element
        # start capturing
        target_element.setCapture()
