class Timer:

    '''
    Timer() a re-implementation of GWT's Timer class.  This class has
    the same interface as GWT's with two minor enhancements in the
    constructor which changes what gets fired when the timer goes off.

    In addition to the constructor, there are four public methods:

       run() -- the method that gets fired when the timer goes off.
       The base class raises a NotImplementedError if it is not
       overridden by a subclass or if Timer isn't instantiated with
       the notify keyword arguement.

       schedule(delayMillis) -- schedule the timer to fire delayMillis
       milliseconds into the future.

       scheduleRepeating(periodMillis) -- schedule the timer to fire
       periodMillis milliseconds into the future and after execution
       (but not until execution is over), automatically reschedule the
       timer.  This is identical to an implementation of run() that
       calls schedule() on itself as its last action.

       cancel() -- cancel a timer.
       
    '''

    __timers = set()

    class __WindowCloseListener:
        ## window closing events
        # cancel all the timers when window is closed
        def onWindowClosed(self):
            for timer in list(Timer.__timers):
                timer.cancel()

        def onWindowClosing(self):
            pass

    def __init__(self, delayMillis=0, notify=None):

        '''Called with no arguments, create a timer that will call its
        run() method when it is scheduled and fired.  This usage
        requires subclassing to implement the run() method.  This is
        GWT's interface and behaviour.

        There are two enhancements to pyjamas' implementation when
        specified with special keyword arguments, one of which
        obviates the need for subclassing.

            timer = Timer(delayMillis=ms)

        is identical to:

            timer = Timer()
            timer.schedule(ms)

        and:

            timer = Timer(notify=object_or_func)
            
        is the same as:

            timer = Timer()
            run = getattr(object_or_func, 'onTimer', object_or_func)
            if not callable(run): raise ValueError, msg

        i.e., the value passed to notify is checked to see if it has
        an onTimer attribute; if so, it is used as the callable, if
        not, the object itself is used as the callable.

        NOTE: when notify is specified, the function or method will be
        called with one argument: the instance of the timer.  So, this
        would be proper usage:

            def timer_cb(timer):
               ...

            timer = Timer(notify=timer_cb)

        or:

            class myclass:

                def __init__(self):
                    ...
                    self.timer = Timer(notify=self)
