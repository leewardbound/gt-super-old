This example is set up so that the JSONRPC python service is run
by default as a CGI Script.  There is an example python CGI script
server which is set up to allow access to the JSONService.py CGI
script, for this example.  Start it as:

    $ cd examples/jsonrpc/output
    $ python PythonCGIServer.py

If you would like to try this example with Apache2, simply point
the Apache2 server at the examples/ subdirectory and then ensure
that Python scripts are allowed to be executed (see Apache2 manuals
to enable).

If you would like the JSONService.py to be executed under mod_python,
move public/services/htaccess.mod_python to public/services/.htaccess
and rebuild (or copy it to output/) and then restart Apache2.

Thanks to Daniel Carvalho for working out how to run this example
with mod_python.
