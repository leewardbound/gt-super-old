=== Globetrotter ===
So you can stop fucking around with redirects!

An open-source routing system with a friendly admin interface.
Send your visitors to a Globetrotter link, and they'll be filtered
to individual destinations as you define.

Referrer-dependant destinations? Check. 
Time of day filters? Check. 
Geoparting? Check.
Test a variant with a random 5% of your traffic? Check.

Now quit dreaming of a system like this, and just use it!
